# TaxometrAPP
First app in android studio with Kotlin. As in the title, it's virtual Taxometr which counts price for taxi course.

App need location to counts price for kilometer and also have mode with timer and entry price.
It is in alfa version and in next features I will apply saving our settings options to file.
At this moment I used bindings, ViewModel, fragments and it have all mathematic implementation that taxometr need.
